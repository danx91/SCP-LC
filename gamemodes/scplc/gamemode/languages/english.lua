Radiating pain to one arm is a common symptom, as is long term malaise and general weakness of heart. If not treated within minutes, it typically leads to death.",

Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These may occur a few times a day or a few times per week.",

This results in people bleeding for a longer time after an injury, easy bruising, and an increased risk of bleeding inside joints or the brain. Characteristic symptoms vary with severity. In general symptoms are internal or external bleeding episodes.",
		oste = "Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mass, micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue leading to bone fragility, and consequent increase in fracture risk. It is the most common reason for a broken bone among the elderly. Bones that commonly break include the vertebrae in the spine, the bones of the forearm, and the hip. Until a broken bone occurs there are typically no symptoms.",

Some individuals with ADHD also display difficulty regulating emotions or problems with executive function. Additionally, it is associated with other mental disorders.",

High platelet counts do not necessarily signal any clinical problems, and can be picked up on a routine full blood count. However, it is important that a full medical history be elicited to ensure that the increased platelet count is not due to a secondary process.",

Urbach–Wiethe disease show bilateral symmetrical calcifications on the medial temporal lobes. These calcifications often affect the amygdala.
